# GlobalAmBC-DRL: SBRC 2026 Artifact

## Overview

This repository provides the experimental artifact for the paper:

**"A New Centralized DRL-Based Control Module for Dense Batteryless IoT Networks with Ambient Backscatter"**

The goal of this artifact is to enable reproducibility of the main results presented in the paper, particularly the temporal behavior of the network success rate under different control strategies.

---

## Artifact Goals

This artifact reproduces the behavior presented in **Figure 3**, demonstrating:

- Instability in networks without control (baseline)
- Stabilization using the GlobalAmBC-DRL module

---

* Operating System: Windows, Linux, or macOS
* Python: version 3.8 or higher
* RAM: at least 2 GB
* Disk: minimal (<100 MB)

---

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Dependencies include:

* pandas
* numpy
* matplotlib

---

## Installation

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/edwardes-galhardo/GlobalAmBC-DRL-SBRC2026
cd GlobalAmBC-DRL-SBRC2026
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Minimal Test

To verify that the artifact is working correctly, run:

```bash
python scripts/plot_figure3.py
```

Expected result:

* File `figures/figure3.png` is generated
* A plot comparing baseline vs GlobalAmBC-DRL is displayed

---

## Experiments

### Claim 1 – Reproduction of Figure 3

To reproduce the main result of the paper:

```bash
bash run_experiment.sh
```

Or manually:

```bash
python scripts/extract_metrics.py
python scripts/run_drl.py
python scripts/plot_figure3.py
```

---

## Expected Output

After execution, the following files should be generated:

```
data/processed/processed_results.csv
results/baseline/results.csv
results/drl/results.csv
figures/figure3.png
```

---

## Expected Results

The generated figure should present:

### Baseline (no control)

* High variability
* Frequent oscillations
* Lower average performance

### GlobalAmBC-DRL

* Reduced variability
* More stable behavior
* Higher average success rate

---

## Security Considerations

This artifact does not pose any security risks:

* No external network access
* No privileged system operations
* No destructive actions

---

## Documentation

Detailed reproduction steps are available in:

```
docs/reproduction_steps.md
```

---

## Notes

* The dataset `figure3_data.csv` is provided to ensure **deterministic reproduction** of the published results.
* The DRL module is included to demonstrate the pipeline structure and system behavior.
* The artifact reproduces the qualitative behavior of the original experiments without requiring OMNeT++ or full DRL training.

---

## Final Remarks

This artifact was designed to ensure clarity, simplicity, and reproducibility, enabling reviewers to validate the main claims of the paper with minimal effort.
